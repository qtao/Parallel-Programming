The [assignment description page](http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:teach:cs420:triangle_counting) shows the prompt which led to this "Triangle Counting" Hadoop implementation.

This assignment required me to create a Map/Reduce solution using Hadoop which was then run on Amazon's AWS service.

Included are both my Python streaming version implementation as well as my Java "Custom JAR" implementation.

Note: This requires Hadoop to be properly set up.  The instructions to run this on Amazon's AWS service are included in the "OLD-README.txt" file which was the original readme used for the assignment's submission.
