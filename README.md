Parallel-Programming
====================

This repo contains a few of my assignment submissions from JHU's Parallel Programming course, taught by professor Randal Burns in Spring 2014.

The [course webpage](http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:teach:cs420:cs420.2014) contains the original assignment descriptions for all projects in this repo.
