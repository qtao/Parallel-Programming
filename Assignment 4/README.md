My implementation of my Parallel Programming class' MPI assignment.

The [assignment description page](http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:teach:cs420:game_of_life) shows the prompt which led to this Game of Life implementation.  As the assignment page states, the goal of this project was not a quicker running time than a serial implementation, but rather to demonstrate our understanding of using MPI in C code properly (without potential deadlocks).

Note: requires mpich2 to complile and run
