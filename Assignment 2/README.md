The [assignment description page](http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:teach:cs420:java_threads) shows the prompt that led to this partial, parallel DES decryption implementation.

This assignment's intention was to have us demonstrate that we understood and could implement Java threads for a parallel program.

The project's original README file is included in the "OLD-README.txt" file.  I also included the bash scripts I wrote to facilitate data collection.
